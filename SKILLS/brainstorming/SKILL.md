# Brainstorming

## When to use this skill
- Before creating features, building components, or adding functionality.
- When the user says "I have an idea" or "Let's plan X".
- When you need to understand requirements before writing code.

## Workflow
- [ ] **Understand the Idea**: Ask questions one at a time to refine the concept.
- [ ] **Explore Approaches**: Propose 2-3 different approaches with trade-offs.
- [ ] **Present Design**: Present the design in small sections (200-300 words) for validation.
- [ ] **Document**: Save the validated design to a markdown file.

## Instructions

### 1. Understanding the Idea
- Check current project context first.
- Ask questions ONE AT A TIME.
- Focus on purpose, constraints, and success criteria.

### 2. Exploring Approaches
- Always propose 2-3 options.
- Explain trade-offs clearly.
- Lead with your recommendation.

### 3. Presenting the Design
- Break design into small, digestible chunks.
- Ask "Does this look right so far?" after each section.
- Cover: Architecture, Components, Data Flow, Error Handling, Testing.

### 4. Key Principles
- **YAGNI**: Remove unnecessary features.
- **Incremental Validation**: Don't dump a huge spec at once.
- **Flexibility**: Be ready to change direction based on feedback.
